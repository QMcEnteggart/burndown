* burndown -- Charting for agile projects
  Uses [[https://github.com/mbostock/d3]] to generate burn-down charts.

** bin/orgserver -- web.py based API server
   Serves org-mode data from the specified org directory, for the
   specified projects.  Attempts to update from git, and kills any
   running servers if changes to the burndown implementation are
   detected.

   The running orgserver puts its python orgserver.py's PID in the org
   directory, in an orgserver.pid.##### file ending with the
   orgserver's own PID.  This is used by subsequent orgservers, to
   locate and terminate the running orgserver.py instances.
   
   Output of orgserver is appended to the org directory's
   orgserver.log file.
